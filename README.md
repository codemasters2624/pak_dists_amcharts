# What is this repository for?
This repository contains a single js file for amcharts. I had a tough time to get hold of a district-wise map for Pakistan so I downloaded data from https://carto.com/dataset/pakistan_districts# and made it compatible with amcharts. This is from 2015 so some new districts and regions are missing. I will be grateful if anyone can continue updating it so others can benefit from it.
Cheers and enjoy!
